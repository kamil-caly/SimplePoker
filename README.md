# SimplePoker

SimplePoker is a minimalist online poker game developed with the goal of learning and showcasing the use of Redux in a React application. In this game, you can challenge a virtual opponent in a game of poker, exchange cards and track your points in real-time. SimplePoker offers an intuitive and interactive way to understand how Redux state management works in a real-world scenario.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
- **Redux**: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps. Redux helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.
- **React-Redux**: Official React bindings for Redux. It lets your React components read data from a Redux store, and dispatch actions to the store to update data.
- **@reduxjs/toolkit**: The official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development. It includes several utility functions that simplify the most common Redux use cases.

## Features

- Play a game of poker against a virtual opponent
- Exchange cards with the deck
- Track your points and your opponent's points in real time
- State managed efficiently with Redux
- Awarding of points based on poker hand rankings.
